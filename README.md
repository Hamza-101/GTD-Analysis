# GTD-Analysis
A data science centered, semester project on Global Terrorism Database(GTD).

# Overview


## Project Phases:
1. Ideation
2. Exploratory Data Analysis
3. ML Model Design or Selection
4. Model Deployment


# Dataset
[Global Terroism Dataset](https://www.start.umd.edu/gtd/)â„¢ (GTD) is an open-source database including information on terrorist events around the world from 1970 through 2020
(with annual updates planned for the future). Unlike many other event databases, the GTD includes systematic data on domestic as well as international terrorist incidents that have occurred during this time period and now includes more than 200,000 cases.
